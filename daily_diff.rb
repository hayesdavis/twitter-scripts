# Tells you how the followers list for a Twitter user has changed since the 
# last execution. As the name implies it's meant to be run once per day but you 
# can run it as often as you want. Provides counts and lists for followers 
# gained and lost during the period since the last execution. The first run, 
# obviously, won't provide any results. Consider setting up a cron job and 
# writing the results to a file for perusal.
#
# Usage: 
#   ./daily_diff.rb screen_name
# 
# Arguments
#   screen_name:
#     the Twitter user to test. Assumes the user isn't protected.
#  
# Requirements/Limitations
#   * You'll need Grackle and the redis Ruby gem.
#   * Assumes you have Redis running on the default port
#   * Assumes the Twitter account is not protected
